# MovieShow
Mobile Application(Android) that displays popular, upcoming, trending and top-rated movies fetched from api and lets you make your own watchlist.

## Features
1. Users can view Popular, Upcoming, trending and top-rated movies(fetched from Api) by clicking on different tabs.
2. Users can add a movie to their watchlist by clicking on the '+' button on a movie card.
3. Users can delete the movie from their watchlist by clicking the '-' button on the movie card in the watchlist.
4. The movies in the watch list are arranged in reverse chronological order based on their addition time, meaning the most recently added movie appears at the top, while the oldest addition is displayed at the bottom.
5. Users can view the detailed view of the movie by clicking on the movie card in any movie list or in watchlist.
6. The app preserves the scroll state of all the movie lists.
7. If the last screen before destroying the app is watchlist, the watchlist screen is opened on re-launching the app.
8. The watchlist retains the movies even after the app is destroyed.
9. If the device is disconnected to the net, the app navigates to the watchlist screen automatically.
10. If we try to open the detailed view of any movie when net is off, we get a retry button to reload the image which gives a Snackbar in case 'Retry' is pressed more than 5 times.
